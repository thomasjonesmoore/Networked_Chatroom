1.
   For this program, we are making a chat room that can host multiple clients
   (up to 255). There are two types of clients, oberserver and participant.
   The participant is the one who sends the message, while the observer just
   watches everything happen. 
2.
   Following the protocol will be the most difficult part of this assignment,
   along with juggling the different types of clients. The protocol is a lot
   bigger than what we have seen in the past, so following that to spec will
   take massive attention to detail. Also, scheduling time for all 3 of us to
   meet up and work on the assignment seems to be a difficult task to overcome.   
3.
   a) Office hours / mentoring hours
   b) StackOverflow and GeeksForGeeks
   c) YouTube or Google keywords "socket api", etc.
4.
   We plan on meeting everyday during class time (i.e. 10-11 MTWF) at the very
   least. As the due date comes closer, we will meet for longer sessions as
   needed, depending on how much progress we have made on the program.
